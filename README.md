JointReview is a means for us to view the community's opinion on games as well as share our own. Made by a gamer for gamers.

### Summary
* JointReview will allow you to easily view updates on the games that matter to you. You will be able to keep track of your submitted reviews and ratings. Any game you review will be added to your personal watch list so you can see updates on what you've reviewed. *

### Problem
So we all play games but to share our opinion on a game one has to go to 2 or 3 third party site. appNames is a hub of all the updates from the community and you get share your opinion with the community as well. All in one place!

### Road Map
- [x] Make landing page offering user to register, summarize features
- [x] Allow users to make account & login
- [ ] Add games to personal watch list
- [ ] Allow user to see other users reviews
